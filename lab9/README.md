#### Comparison

##### Decorator Pattern

In our example we try to change how the word bacon is printed on paper(as seen in the five guys burger example).
The following things can be understood from implementing the solution to the same problem using the usual design pattern and while using lambda functions:

1. We do not need a bunch of extra concrete decorator classes to change our print during runtime.
2. Lambda functions seem to be more readable and the solution could be easily understood.


##### Chain of Responsibilty

We try to implement an example where the program has to print if the number is odd or even and also display if the number is a prime number or not.
The following things can be understood from implementing the solution to the same problem using the usual design pattern and while using lambda functions:

1. The use of lambda function somewhat complicated the main method as we expect to return a String from lambda.
2. The original solution using design pattern seems to be more elegant when compared to the code using lambda function.

##### Conclusion

It is safe to say that, though lambda functions help to write better code, they may not be the best alternative for all the design patterns.
